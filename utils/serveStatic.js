/*
Challenge 4:

1. Create and export a function called 'serveStatic'. 
   It should take in the base directory as a parameter.

2. Build a path to index.html in the 'public' folder and save it to a const 'filePath'. 
   (Which node module will you need to import to do this? Which method joins the path together?)

3. Log 'filePath' to the console.
*/
import path from 'node:path'

export function serveStatic(baseDir) {
  const filePath = path.join(baseDir, 'public','index.htlm')
  console.log(filePath)
}
